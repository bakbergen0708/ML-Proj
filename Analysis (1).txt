Оригинальный текст:
 Hi! One of the best parts of Indian culture is an Indian wedding. So today I decided to fake Mary my actual girlfriend in an Indian wedding. Here's how our Indian wedding went. The day before we got the Hina, the jewelry and the fancy clothes and invited all of our Indian friends. On wedding day, I, the groom arrived on a beautiful horse surrounded by good looking friends and lots of fireworks and music. And then I waited for my bride to arrive. She did arrive on a boat then was carried by four men to meet her new husband. Together we performed Hindu rituals to unofficially become husband and wife. And from that point on our Indian wedding began. With amazing food, dance and music. It's true our wedding was not real but the richness of Indian culture, weddings and people are as real as they get.
